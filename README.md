## Name of the Game: Blue Footed Booby Bounce 

#### Objective: 
  1. Gain as many points as you can by bouncing the blue-footed-booby through the pillars without touching them! 
  2. If you touch a pillar, the game is over
  3. Try to beat your high score

#### Main technologies: 
  -HTML, CSS, JS

#### Major Problems: 
  1. Using collision detection to determine at which x and y values do the bird and the pillar make contact
  2. Using local stoarge to track the player's high score
  3. Building the game in canvas
  
#### Possible Solutions:
  1. Reading as much documentation as necessary to make my collision detection work
  2. Keeping the bird at one position on the main axis and measuring the pillars' x values as they change

#### Approach Taken:
  1. First, I learned the very basics of HTML Canvas and followed some basic tutorials on created canvas elements and animating them.
  2. After that, I experimented with animations to program the basic movements of my game which is having Booby jump and having the pipes move accross the screen.
  3. Then, I figured out a way to generate the pipes continuously so the player can play for as long as they want (or as long as they can).
  4. Next, I white-boarded some diagrams to visualize the conditions necessary for collision and wrote pseudo code that I eventually turned into real code.
  5. Finally, I added some instructions and styling to make the game come together. Voila!
  
## Upcoming Features:

##### Adding multiple levels:
Playing this game will be even more fun when there are multiple challenges added. The next challenge will be increasing the number of pipes after the player lasts a certain amount of time playing.  
##### Leader scoreboard: 
Players will be able to add their name to keep track of their score and a leader board will show who has the highest points
##### Choose your own Booby: 
Players can choose their own Booby - avatar.
